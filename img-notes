## Images
<img>
>To add an image into the page you need to use an <img> element. 
This is an empty element (which means there is no closing tag).  
It must carry the following two attributes:
<src> This tells the browser where it can find the image file.  
This will usually be a relative URL pointing to an image on your own site.  
<alt> This provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it.  
title You can also use the title attribute with the <img> element to provide additional information about the image.   
Most browsers will display the content of this attribute in a tootip when the user hovers over the image.  

>You will also often see an <img> element use two other attributes that specify its size:  
# height   
>This specifies the height of the image in pixels.  
# width  
>This specifies the width of the image in pixels.    
Images often take longer to load than the HTML code that makes up the rest of the page. It is,   
therefore, a good idea to specify the size of the image so that the browser can render the rest   
of the text on the page while leaving the right amount of space for the image that is still loading.  
The size of images is increasingly being specified using CSS rather than HTML  

<align 
>The align attribute was commonly used to indicate how the other parts of a page should flow around an image.   
It has been removed from HTML5 and new websites should use CSS to control the alignment  
I have discussed it here because you are likely to come across it if you look at older code,   
and because some visual editors still insert this attribute when you indicate how an image should be aligned.  
The align attribute can take these horizontal values:  
left This aligns the image to the left (allowing text to flow around its right-hand side).  
right This aligns the image to the right (allowing text to flow around its left-hand side).  

## Color

>The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element.   
You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:  
rgb values These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are
used to make it up. For example: rgb(100,100,90)  
 hex Codes These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color,   
 preceded by a pound or hash # sign. For example: #ee3e80   
Color names There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers.  
For example: DarkCyan  
We look at these three different ways of specifying colors on the next double-page spread.  
CSS3 has also introduced another way to specify colors called HSLA  

## Styling  
>There are properties to control the choice of font, size, weight, style, and spacing.  
Theris a limited choice of fonts that you can assume   most people will have installed.  
If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are  several options, but you need   
to have the right license to use them.  
You can control the space between lines of text,  individual letters, and words.   
Text can also be aligned to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be indented.  
You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an    
element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or when they have visited a link.
